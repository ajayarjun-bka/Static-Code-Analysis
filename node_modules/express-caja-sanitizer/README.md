# express-caja-sanitizer
An express middleware inspired from express-sanitizer but additionally sanitizes URL params. It also gives an option to provide a preprocessor function to decide whether a (key, value) pair should be sanitized or not.

## Installation
```
npm install express-caja-sanitizer
```

## Usage
Needs to be called after express.bodyParser() and before anything that requires the sanitized input, e.g.:

```
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var cajaSanitizer = require('express-caja-sanitizer');

var app = express();

app.use(bodyParser());
app.use(cajaSanitizer());

```

## URL Params
This module by default sanitizes the request URL params (`req.params`), apart from request body and query string params, e.g.:

```
http://www.myapp.com/rest/user/<script>console.log("hello")</script>bob/details
```

will be sanitized as

```
http://www.myapp.com/rest/user/bob/details
```

## Options

#### `shouldSanitize`
When `shouldSanitize` function is provided as an option, the module will sanitize only the (key, value) pairs for which the function returns `true`.

For example, if we don't want to sanitize XML values then the preprocesser function can be

```
var shouldSanitize = function(key, value) {
  return !value.startsWith('<?xml version="1.0"')
}
```

##Limitations
This is a basic implementation of [Caja-HTML-Sanitizer](https://github.com/theSmaw/Caja-HTML-Sanitizer) with the specific purpose of mitigating against persistent XSS risks.

##Caveats
This module trusts the dependencies to provide basic persistent XSS risk mitigation. A user of this package should review all packages and make their own decision on security and fitness for purpose.
